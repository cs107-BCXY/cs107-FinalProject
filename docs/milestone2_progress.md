What has each group member done since the submission of Milestone1.i

Charlie is working on the forward mode and implementing the test code for that section. 

Xiang is looking into a possible extension in the form of creating the reverse mode method.

The group will handle the documentation for their specific sections but will review the documentation as a whole and ensure that the code coverage is at the min of 90%. We will also convene about the organization of the package/modules together.
