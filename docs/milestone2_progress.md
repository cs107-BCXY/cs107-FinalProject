# Milestone 2b - Progress Check

This progress report includes (1) what tasks each group member has been assigned for Milestone 2 and (2) what each group member has done since the submission of Milestone 1. The descriptions of what tasks each member has been assigned will be broad, describing the general areas that each member will work on. Each of these areas will include the module development, testing, and documentation for that area. All group members will help to review each other's documentation and to ensure that the code coverage is at the minimum 90%. All members will also meet to further discuss the organization of the package and its modules.

- Bowen is working on defining the elementary functions (ex. log, sin, exp etc.) and their derivatives.

- Charlie is working on the implementation of forward mode and developing test cases.

- Xiang is looking into a possible extension in the form of creating the reverse mode method. He will also assist Charlie in implementing forward mode and developing its tests.

- Yaxin is working implementing the variables. This includes collaboration with Bowen on how to best get elementary functions to properly work with both real and dual variables.
